          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>1.)Lack of Healthcare(%) increased as you trended towards lower Household Income(Median).
            Likewise, the higher the Poverty(%) led to higher Lack of Healthcare(%).
          </p>

          <p>2.)Household Income also seems to have a correlation with the liklihood to smoke. Per our graph you can see that the highest
            Smoke(%) is seen at the lowest Household Income levels. It is also interesting to note that Utah by far had the lowest smoking percentage, below 10%.
          </p>

          <p>3.)The state of Mississippi had the one of the highest obesity percenatages, along with having the highest
            poverty percenatge at over 20%. Household Income continues to have a strong role, as you can see in our graph that 
            the highest levels of obesity are seen at the lowest levels of income median.
